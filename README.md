This repository has been initialized as a copy of [https://github.com/alecjacobson/nested_cages](https://github.com/alecjacobson/nested_cages), but has been reconfigured to support the newer version of the libgl library as well as the dependencies required for calls to the viewer to work. After cloning, please replace the following files with their counterparts in the original version:

```
libigl/external/tetgen
libigl/include/igl/copyleft/cgal
libigl/include/igl/copyleft/tetgen
```
