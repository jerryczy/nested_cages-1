This repository has been initialized as a copy of [https://github.com/alecjacobson/nested_cages](https://github.com/alecjacobson/nested_cages) that will serve as a temporary host for new features (in particular, support for nested cages in the dynamic setting). It has been reconfigured to support the newer version of the libgl library as well as the dependencies required for calls to the viewer to work.
